  # Commit & dashboard rules:   
  1) Use only english and past simple tense.
  2) Use Upper chars in the beginning.
  3) Single reason for commit.
  4) Use active voice
  5) Write at the end of the commit message string `AB#* ticket number *`.
  
  Commit example: 
  ```C
  Created commit rules AB#30
  ```
  or      
  ```C
  Fixed ball disappearing bug  AB#12 
  ```
  That creates link to your commit in azure boards.
